My work discusses facing and overcoming traumatic experiences, leading to healing journeys that ultimately uplift the collective Consciousness. Through my work, I bring awareness to how we treat our emotions as humans, emphasizing mental health as a whole. I create these figures, or \"soul bodies,\" as I call them, to talk about difficult emotions, such as depression, anxiety, and even positive emotions, like joy and feelings of unity.  <\/p><p>Vivid neon colors are a recurring theme in my work to describe intense emotion within our bodies. Each \"soul body\" figure has its own color scheme and energy pattern inside itself, and in combination with the colors, these patterns tell a story about that figure's energy. In addition, some have auras, which shine outside the body and add to the soul's energy story. Most soul bodies are androgynous, focusing on the inner energy patterns that make up their being. Often, they wander in an unknown space leading \"somewhere,\" which represents the subconscious mind. In this space, the soul bodies come across trauma, memories, and subjective reality based on their perceptions. This alternate reality created in my work can be applied to our daily lives and subconscious thinking. <\/p><p><\/p><p>I often create in both 2D and 3D mediums. However, I primarily use paint on canvas and digital software to do my work. I start my process by brainstorming, sometimes using free association techniques, and writing down everything that comes to mind. I often incorporate meditation practices into my brainstorming process to let the ideas and visions come through. Usually, the work's title will come through to me first before the composition is worked out. Then, through the materials I use, I create this dimension where the \"soul bodies\" coexist in their storylines, helping each other heal.<\/p><p><\/p><p>My artwork and practice aim to inspire action on healing and awakening in oneself. Mental health is an essential upcoming topic for the next few decades, and I believe in the accessibility of everyone being able to treat their mental health. We need to address our emotions as human beings and learn how to cope with them healthily. I hope my work inspires that spark of movement to look within and identify these emotions.<\/p>","link_text":"","link_url":"","link_text2":"","link_url2":"","button_style":"fill","button_size":"base","background":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","background_gradient":"","text_color":"#f2f2f2","text_gradient":"","button_background":"#000000","button_text_color":"#ffffff"}}},"block_order":["template--15015000670289__8d2dfbb9-60f2-49ad-922c-a9e13b7e9fd9-image-1"],"custom_css":[".media-with-text__media {width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; \/* Pushes the image to the right *\/}",".media-with-text__content {width: 100%; display: block; margin-right: auto; \/* Pushes the text to the left *\/}"," {padding-top: 0%; background-color: black;}"],"settings":{"full_width":true,"allow_transparent_header":false,"spacing":"medium","sec_font":"futura_n4","background":"#000000","background_gradient":""}},"main":{"type":"main-collection","disabled":true,"settings":{"products_per_page":24,"products_per_row_mobile":"2","products_per_row_desktop":4,"filter_layout":"horizontal","show_sort_by":false,"show_filters":false,"show_filter_group_name":false,"show_color_swatch":false,"show_empty_filter_values":false,"show_filter_values_count":false,"open_first_filter_group":false}},"banner":{"type":"collection-banner","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":true,"allow_transparent_header":true,"enable_parallax":false,"show_collection_title":true,"show_collection_description":true,"show_collection_image":true,"collection_title_size":"h1","image_size":"auto","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/InvizDefault.Desktop.Collection.jpg","mobile_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/InvizDefault.Mobile.Collection.jpg","mobile_text_position":"place-self-end-start text-start","desktop_text_position":"sm:place-self-center-start sm:text-start","featured_product":"","featured_product_heading":"Top Product","text_color":"#ffffff","overlay_color":"#000000","overlay_opacity":26}},"ac3ffc94-e074-463a-8db2-f89650219de6":{"type":"custom-liquid","disabled":true,"custom_css":[],"settings":{"full_width":true,"remove_vertical_spacing":false,"remove_horizontal_spacing":false,"liquid":"<html>","background":"#39bfc9","background_gradient":"","text_color":""}}},"order":["52137244-37d7-4158-a7df-3cd255acd20f","d36975a8-88b2-4068-9854-2b9ba291c3bd","8d2dfbb9-60f2-49ad-922c-a9e13b7e9fd9","main","banner","ac3ffc94-e074-463a-8db2-f89650219de6"]}
